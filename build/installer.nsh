; NSIS script included by electron-builder to run during installer creation
; This script adds pre-install checks during installation for required runtime
; dependencies (Python, Java, Tesseract). It presents the user with clear links
; to download installers if any dependency is missing. This file intentionally
; does not attempt to auto-install those dependencies â€” the user must follow
; the provided links so they can complete a reliable manual install.
