IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE
================================================================================

This is a PLACEHOLDER End User License Agreement provided for development and 
testing purposes. While it reflects the intended licensing philosophy of 
openElara (open-source, free for personal/internal use, commercial licensing 
for derivatives), this document has NOT been reviewed by qualified legal 
counsel.

Before any commercial use, public distribution, or deployment of this software 
or derivative works, this EULA must be reviewed and approved by legal 
professionals familiar with open-source licensing, intellectual property law, 
and commercial software licensing in your jurisdiction(s).

DO NOT rely on this document for actual legal protection without professional 
legal review.

================================================================================
1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
================================================================================

By installing, copying, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using openElara 
(the "Software"), you ("User", "You", "Your") agree to be bound by the terms 
of this End User License Agreement ("EULA" or "Agreement").

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE.

This Agreement is between You and Andrew Quartly trading as Apply My Tech 
("Licensor", "We", "Us", "Our"), the creator and distributor of openElara.

================================================================================
2. GRANT OF LICENSE
================================================================================

2.1 OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
openElara is open-source software. The source code is publicly available 
for inspection, modification, and distribution under the terms specified in 
this EULA and the accompanying LICENSE file.

2.2 PERSONAL USE LICENSE (FREE)
We grant You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:
  - Download, install, and use the Software for personal purposes
  - Modify the Software for personal use
  - Run the Software on any number of devices You personally own
  - Share the unmodified Software with others (attribution required)

2.3 INTERNAL BUSINESS USE LICENSE (FREE)
Organizations may use openElara internally without charge, including:
  - Installation on employee workstations
  - Integration into internal workflows
  - Modification for internal use only
  - Training and onboarding with the Software

EXCLUSION: Internal use does NOT include:
  - Reselling the Software or access to it
  - Embedding in products sold to customers
  - Offering as a service (SaaS) to external users
  - Using as a component of a commercial product

2.4 COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE LICENSE (REQUIRES AGREEMENT)
If You create a derivative work or commercial product based on openElara that:
  - Is sold, licensed, or offered as a service to third parties
  - Generates revenue directly or indirectly from use of this Software

You MUST obtain a separate Commercial Derivative License from the Licensor 
BEFORE distributing or monetizing such derivative work.

Contact: openelara@applymytech.com for commercial licensing inquiries.

2.5 ROYALTY STRUCTURE (COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES)
Commercial derivatives that generate revenue may be subject to royalty 
agreements. The Licensor's philosophy is:

  "We'd rather have 0.1% of $100 million than 90% of nothing."

Royalty rates are designed to be reasonable, revenue-based (not punitive), 
and structured to encourage success rather than prevent it. Specific terms 
are negotiated per use case.

Early-stage startups, non-profits, and educational institutions may qualify 
for reduced or deferred royalty arrangements.
