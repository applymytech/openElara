; Deprecated helper file.
; The project previously placed dependency checks here. The new NSIS include
; is `build/installer.nsh` which implements interactive pre-install checks and
; user-facing guidance. Keep this file present for backwards compatibility, but
; prefer editing `build/installer.nsh` for installer behavior.
