You are granted a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to:
  - Use the Software for personal, educational, or research purposes
  - Modify the Software for personal use
  - Share modified versions with others for non-commercial purposes
  - Study, learn from, and build upon the code

No royalties, fees, or permissions are required for personal use.

================================================================================
3. INTERNAL BUSINESS USE LICENSE (FREE)
================================================================================

Organizations may use the Software internally without charge, including:
  - Deployment within an organization for employee use
  - Modification for internal workflows and processes
  - Integration with internal systems and tools

EXCLUSION: Internal use does NOT include:

  - Embedding the Software in products sold to third parties
  - Offering the Software as a service (SaaS) to external users
  - Using the Software as a component of a revenue-generating product

================================================================================
4. COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE LICENSE (REQUIRES AGREEMENT)
================================================================================

COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES are prohibited without a separate licensing agreement.

A "Commercial Derivative" is any work that:
  - Is sold, licensed, or offered as a paid service to third parties
  - Generates revenue directly or indirectly from use of this Software
  - Incorporates substantial portions of the codebase or functionality
  - Competes with openElara as a commercial offering
  - Is embedded in a product or service sold to external customers

If you wish to create a commercial derivative, you MUST:
  1. Contact the copyright holder BEFORE distribution or monetization
  2. Negotiate a separate Commercial Derivative License
  3. Agree to royalty terms appropriate to your use case

Contact: openelara@applymytech.com

PHILOSOPHY: The copyright holder's goal is to enable commercial success, not
prevent it. Royalty structures are designed to be reasonable and revenue-based:

  "We'd rather have 0.1% of $100 million than 90% of nothing."

Early-stage startups, non-profits, and educational institutions may qualify
for reduced or deferred royalty arrangements.

================================================================================
5. REUSABLE COMPONENTS LICENSE
================================================================================

Certain standalone components of openElara may be extracted and used in other
projects under more permissive terms if they meet ALL of the following criteria:

  - The component is self-contained and does not depend on openElara's core
  - The component represents less than 5% of openElara's total codebase
  - The component is clearly documented as reusable (e.g., tokenManager.js)
  - Proper attribution is provided

EXAMPLES OF POTENTIALLY REUSABLE COMPONENTS:
  - tokenManager.js (token counting and truncation utilities)
  - Standalone utility functions clearly marked as reusable
  - Generic UI components not specific to openElara's functionality

EXAMPLES OF NON-REUSABLE COMPONENTS (Require Commercial License):
  - RAG system and ChromaDB integration
  - Character personality system
  - Multi-modal API orchestration
  - Ingestion and file processing pipeline
  - Any component that represents "substantial functionality" of openElara

When in doubt, contact the copyright holder for clarification.

If you contribute code, documentation, or other materials to the openElara
project (via pull requests, patches, issues, etc.), you:
